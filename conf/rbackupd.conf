### This is the global configuration file for rbackupd.
###
### Generally, when multiple values are not supported, only the first one will
### be used.

### This is the section that specifies all values related to logging.
[logging]
    ### The path to the logfile.
    logfile = /var/log/rbackupd/log

    ### Specifies the loglevel. Available values are:
    ###
    ### quiet - only warnings and errors will be logged
    ### default - default log level
    ### verbose - more information will be logged
    ### debug - debug mode
    ###
    ### Every log level implicitly contains all log levels below.
    loglevel = debug

[rsync]
### Specify the absolute path of the rsync executable here if necessary.
### Otherwise, the executable will be searched in $PATH.
#cmd = /usr/bin/rsync


[tasks]
    ### This is the default section. The settings specified here will be applied to
    ### all tasks as long as they are not overwritten in the specific task section.

    ### This specifies whether rsync will create a logfile in the destination
    ### directory. rsync_logfile_name specifies the name of the logfile,
    ### rsync_logfile_format specifies the format of that logfile. See the
    ### "--log-file-format" options in rsync(1) and the "log format" section
    ### in rsyncd.conf(5) to get a list of paramters. Leave it blank to use the
    ### default.
    rsync_logfile = yes
    rsync_logfile_name = rsync.log
    rsync_logfile_format =

    ### These are the filters applied to the file list by rsync. "filter" is
    ### the most versatile options, "include" and "exclude" are simplified
    ### options that should suffice in most cases. "includefile"/"excludefile"
    ### specify files from which "include" and "exclude" patterns will be read.
    ### Note that the order of these options matter, as the first matching
    ### pattern will be used. The order is the following:
    ### - filter
    ### - include
    ### - includefile
    ### - exclude
    ### - excludefile
    ### See the section "FILTER RULES" in rsync(1) and the README for more
    ### details. You can specify as many lines as you want per option.
    filters = ""

    includes = ""
    includefiles = ""

    excludes = ""
    excludefiles = ""

    ### This states whether the destination directory should be created if it
    ### does not exists already. This is particularly useful when backing up to
    ### a removable device to prevent creating a backup in the usual mountpoint
    ### of this device if it is not currently mounted.
    create_destination = False

    ### This specifies whether rsync will cross filesystem boudaries when
    ### creating the backup. Note that rsync treats a "bind" mount to the same
    ### device as being on the same filesystem.
    one_fs = False

    ### These are the arguments that will be passed directly to rsync, so every
    ### argument in rsync(1) can be used. The overall order will be preserved.
    ### ATTENTION:
    ### Only edit these lines if you know what you are doing, otherwise the
    ### creation of backups might fail. At least the --archive/-a options
    ### should be included.
    rsync_args = -aHAXvh --relative --no-implied-dirs

    ### These are the arguments passed to ssh when starting a remote
    ### connection.
    ssh_args = -p 22

    [[test]]
        ### These are the sources that will be backed up.
        sources = /home/hannes/testing/source/home

        ### This is the destination of the backup.
        destination = /home/hannes/testing/destination/

        [[[intervals]]]
            ### This is the interval in which the task will be run. The format is
            ### similar to the one of cron(8), see the README for more details.
            ### NOTE: If more than one backup is scheduled for the same time (this
            ### might for example happen when you have a "daily" and an "hourly" backup
            ### at the beginning of the day), the one HIGHER in this list takes
            ### precedence. Therefore it is advisable to set the "longer" intervals
            ### higher to get a more consistent backup scheme.
            daily = 30 0 * * * *
            hourly = 0 * * * * *
            minutely = * * * * * *

        [[[keep]]]
            ### This is the count of backups that will be kept. The deletion of backups
            ### will be done AFTER the creation of new ones, so the newly created
            ### one will be counted, too.
            ### ATTENTION: You must not be set to a negative value or zero.
            ### NOTE: In contrast to the "interval" key, the order does not matter.
            daily = 7
            hourly = 24
            minutely = 5

        [[[age]]]
            ### This is the maximum age of a backup of a specific interval before it
            ### will be deleted. You can specify either minutes (m), hours (h),
            ### weeks (w), days (d) or months(M). Mixing of these is not supported.
            ### NOTE: In contrast to the "interval" key, the order does not matter.
            daily = 1M
            hourly = 24h
            minutely = 1h
