### This is the global configuration file for rbackupd.
###
### Generally, when multiple values are not supported, only the first one will
### be used.

[rsync]
    ### Specify the absolute path of the rsync executable here if necessary.
    ### Otherwise, the executable will be searched in $PATH.
    #cmd = "/usr/bin/rsync"

### This is a section that specifies devices that will be mounted when rbackupd
### starts. Specify as many of these sections as necessary.
[mount]
    ### This is the device. You can either specify it by path (/dev/sda), UUID
    ### (UUID=...) or label (LABEL=...)
    device = "/dev/sda"

    ### This is the primary mountpoint where the device will be mounted. This
    ### should be a location where no normal user has access to, to prevent
    ### users tinkering with their backups.
    mountpoint = "/root/backup"

    ### This is the mountpoint where the backups will be available in readonly
    ### mode. You can use this to give users access to their backups without
    ### enabling them to tinker with them. If you do not need this, just leave
    ### it blank.
    mountpoint_ro = "/backup"

    ### These settings apply to the corresponding mountpoints definded above.
    ### They specify whether a mountpoint will be created if not already
    ### present.
    mountpoint_create = false
    mountpoint_ro_create = true

### This is the default section. The settings specified here will be applied to
### all tasks as long as they are not overwritten in the specific task section.
[default]
    ### This specifies whether rsync will create a logfile in the destination
    ### directory. rsync_logfile_name specifies the name of the logfile,
    ### rsync_logfile_format specifies the format of that logfile. See the
    ### "--log-file-format" options in rsync(1) and the "log format" section
    ### in rsyncd.conf(5) to get a list of paramters. Leave it blank to use the
    ### default.
    rsync_logfile = yes
    rsync_logfile_name = "rsync.log"
    rsync_logfile_format =

    ### These are the filters applied to the file list by rsync. You can also
    ### use the simplified arguments (include/exclude/includefile/excludefile)
    ### below. See the "--filter" option in rsync(1) and the README for more
    ### details.
    filter =

    ### These are the include and exclude patterns. See the "--exclude" and
    ### "--include" options in rsync(1) and the README for more details.
    include=
    exclude=

    ### There are files containing include and exclude patterns. See the
    ### "--exclude-from" and "--include-from" options in rsync(1) and the
    ### README for more details.
    includefile=
    excludefile=

    ### This states whether the destination directory should be created if it
    ### does not exists already. This is particularly useful when backing up to
    ### a removable device to prevent creating a backup in the usual mountpoint
    ### of this device if it is not currently mounted.
    create_destination = no

    ### This specifies whether rsync will cross filesystem boudaries when
    ### creating the backup. Note that rsync treats a "bind" mount to the same
    ### device as being on the same filesystem.
    one_fs = no

    ### These are the arguments that will be passed directly to rsync, so every
    ### argument in rsync(1) can be used. The overall order will be preserved.
    ### ATTENTION:
    ### Only edit these lines if you know what you are doing, otherwise the
    ### creation of backups might fail. At least the --archive/-a options
    ### should be included.
    rsync_args = "-aHAXvh --relative"
    rsync_args = "--no-implied-dirs"

    ### These are the arguments passed to ssh when starting a remote
    ### connection.
    ssh_args = "-p 22"

[task]
    ### This is the name of the task. It will be appended to every backup
    ### folder.
    name = "test"

    ### These are the sources that will be backed up.
    source = "/home/hannes/testing/source/home"

    ### This is the destination of the backup.
    destination = "/home/hannes/testing/destination/"

    ### This is the interval in which the task will be run. The format is
    ### similar to the one of cron(8), see the README for more details.
    ### NOTE: If more than one backup is scheduled for the same time (this
    ### might for example happen when you have a "daily" and an "hourly" backup
    ### at the beginning of the day), the one HIGHER in this list takes
    ### precedence. Therefore it is advisable to set the "longer" intervals
    ### higher to get a more consistent backup scheme.
    interval["daily"] = "30 0 * * * *"
    interval["hourly"] = "0 * * * * *"
    interval["minutely"] = "* * * * * *"

    ### This is the count of backups that will be kept. The deletion of backups
    ### will be done AFTER the creation of new ones, so the newly created
    ### one will be counted, too.
    ### ATTENTION: You should not set this to 0, as in this case, all backups
    ### will be deleted.
    ### NOTE: In contrast to the "interval" key, the order does not matter.
    keep["daily"] = 7
    keep["hourly"] = 24
    keep["minutely"] = 60
