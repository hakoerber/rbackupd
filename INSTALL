INTALLING

To install, just run

    # python setup.py install

with root privileges.

Now look into the template configuration file located at

    /etc/rbackupd/rbackupd.conf

Every options has a thorough description, so an initial setup should be easy.
Modify it to your needs.




RUNNING

To run rbackupd, just execute

    # rbackupd

This will use the configuration file at /etc/rbackupd/rbackupd.conf. If you
want to use a different location, use the -c switch. You require root
privileges for the program to work.

There is also a systemd service file shipped with the program. If you want to
run rbackupd as a systemd service, you can do so by executing

    # systemctl enable rbackupd.service

This will make sure rbackupd is executed on next boot. If you want to start it
right away, execute

    # systemctl start rbackupd.service

With this method rbackupd will use the default configuration file at

     /etc/rbackupd/rbackupd.conf

If you want to use a different file, you have to edit the systemd service file
located at

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/rbackupd.service

Look at the ExecStart line and add --config=<your config> at the end of it. Then
you have to tell systemd to reload the new service file by executing

    # systemctl daemon-reload

If rbackupd is not running, it will use the new configuration file when it is
started next time. If it is running, restart it by running

	# systemctl restart rbackupd.service
