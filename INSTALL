    python setup.py install

with root privileges.

Now look into the template configuration file located at

    /etc/rbackupd/rbackupd.conf

Every options has a thorough description, so an initial setup should be easy.
Modify it to your needs.

To run rbackupd, just execute

    rbackupd <path to the configuration file>

Root privileges are only required when you try to access or write files that
do not belong to you.

For Arch Linux users, there is a PKGBUILD available at
