To install, just run

    # python setup.py install

with root privileges.

Now look into the template configuration file located at

    /etc/rbackupd/rbackupd.conf

Every options has a thorough description, so an initial setup should be easy.
Modify it to your needs.

To run rbackupd, just execute

    # rbackupd

This will use the configuration file at /etc/rbackupd/rbackupd.conf. If you
want to use a different location, use the -c switch. You require root
privileges for the program to work.

For Arch Linux users, there is a PKGBUILD available at

    http://github.com/whatevsz/pkgbuilds/blob/master/rbackupd-git/PKGBUILD

that will install the latest version from the git repository.
