ssh_args =

Support ssh connections. The overridable key ssh_args is directly passed to
rsync after the -e options, e.g. the above would lead to

    rsync -e "ssh -p 22" ...

rbackupd does not support interactive authentification through passwords, so
public-key-authentification has to be set up beforehand.

When "ssh_args" is left blank, only

    -e "ssh"

will passed to rsync.

When using ssh, you can use the usual ssh syntax for rsync arguments, as
described in rsync(1):

    [[USER@]HOST:]SRC DEST
    SRC [[USER@]HOST:]DEST

Note that you can specify different machines in every source key, as a separate
rsync command will be issued for every source. When you ommit the USER, the
current username will be used to connect to the remote host.

If you do set the key (maybe inplicitly in the [default] section) but do not
use the ssh syntax for source or destination, the arguments will be passed
anyway, but are insigificant.
