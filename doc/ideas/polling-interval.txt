The polling interval should depend on the "shortest" backup interval. For
example, when you want to backup every minute (what you most likely don't), the
polling interval must be one minute at maximum. In contrast, when you only
backup every hour, this is not necessary, as polling hourly would suffice. The
easiest way to go would to offer an option in the configuration file.
