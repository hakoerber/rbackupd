When using rsync over ssh, the following problem arises: We have to somehow
check the destination folders to create the "backup repository". So a standalone
ssh connection would be necessary. Instead, we could use sshfs to mount the
remote folder into the local filesystem, so we can perform all actions locally
on that mountpoint. Backdraw: We cannot do any checks about the remote folders
(whether they exist for example) without the standalone ssh connection mentioned
before, so one would be necessary anyway. But the procedure would be a lot
cleaner, as we could do the checks over the connection, terminate it, and then
use sshfs. This way, we could later extend the procedure and do remote mounting
for example, but be done with it before actually doing the backup.
