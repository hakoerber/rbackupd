Two problems regarding the backup folders:

1) When the backup process is interrupted, the backup will remain unfinished but
   will seen a finished at the next start of the program, which leads to an
   potential unwanted full backup when the unfinished backup is used as link
   dest.

2) Backup information is derived from the folder name, which is quite limited
   inflexible.

Both of these can be remedied by placing a special "backup info" file into the
directory. When this is done after the backup is finished, it can be used as a
marker for valid backups. When the file does not exist, the backup can easily be
identified as unfinished. We can even go so far as to say that a folder lacking
this file can be ignored completely.

This file can also conveniently be used to story meta information about the
backup. We can use the rbackupd.config module to parse this file for maximum
flexibility, or use a simple char separated format.

Proposal for the file naming and content:

Name: rbackupd.info

Content:
<name>
<date>
<interval name>

<date> should be easily parsable, so we can use datetime.timestamp() and
datetime.fromtimestamp().

One problem arises: We can no longer use symlinks on the topmost repository
level, as the meta information is no longer stored in the folder name but in the
folder itself, so symlinks would inherit the information of their target.
Therefore, we need to create the symlinks "one level deeper". The content of the
backup folder is on the one hand the rbackupd.info file and on the other hand a
folder containing the backup itself, let's just call it "backup".

We can still keep the naming of the backup folder, as it makes for easier
sorting and identifying of the different backups, but we do no longer use the
name itself to hold the information but the rbackupd.info file.

The resulting structure would look something like this:

repo --+-- name_date_interval.snapshot --+-- rbackupd.info
       |                                 |
       |                                 +-- backup --+-- home
       |                                              |
       |                                              +-- etc
       |                                              .
       |                                              .
       |
       +-- name_date_interval.snapshot --+-- rbackupd.info
       |                                 |
       |                                 +-- backup -> ../[...]/backup (symlink)
       .
       .
