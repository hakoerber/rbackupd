As a month does not have a fixed amount of days, an interval of n months is not
representable in a timedelta. Therefore, we define an interval of one month as
the time between this day and the current day of the month one month ago. So for
24.10. this means one month ago was 24.09.. If the current day of the month does
not exist in the previous month, the maximum day of the month for the previous
month is assumed. For 31.03 this means one month ago was the 28.03. or the 29.03
in leap years.
