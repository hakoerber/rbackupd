Specify various [mount] sections where devices and corresponding mountpoints
can be specified.

Each [mount] section specifies a device, either by path, label or UUID, and
the keys mountpoint and mountpoint_ro. The latter can be empty.

When starting rbackupd, it mounts the devices in every [mount] section on both
mountpoints "mountpoint_{rw,ro}" if necessary. "mountpoint" is required,
this is the point rbackupd writes to. It should be somewhere where not user
(except root of course) has access to, e.g. /root/. "mountpoint_ro" can be
omitted, if not, this is the point where the device will be mounted readonly.
You can use this to expose the backups to all users without giving them write
access.

the corresponding options "mountpoint_{rw,ro}_create specify whether a missing
mountpoint should be created. "mountpoint_create" has to be present,
"mountpoint_ro_create" is only necessary if "mountpoint_ro" is set, it is
ignored if superfluous.
