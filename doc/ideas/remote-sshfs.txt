We can make the whole backup process host-independent with sshfs. It can be used
to mount remote devices or folders into the local tree. After that, we can
access it through all methods on local files/directories. The tricky part is the
mounting itself. Problems:

1)
We need a conventient way to address remote hosts in the configuration file. We
can either use a separate key, e.g. "host=<ip>" or a special host syntax for
directores, as used by ssh itself, like "<ip>:/dir/"

2)
We also need a way to specify the user on the remote machine. The method used in
(1) might be extended, with another key or "<user>@<ip>:/dir/"-like syntax.

3)
sshfs cannot mount a device directly, it can only mount a directory. Therefore,
either we disable automounting for remote devices, or we need a separate ssh
connection to mount the remote device on the remote host and then use sshfs to
mount the mountpoint to our local machine.
