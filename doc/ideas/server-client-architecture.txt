The new architecture of rbackupd could look like this:

We divide rbackupd into two programs:

1) rbackupd (the daemon)
2) rbackupd-client

The daemon runs as a service with root prvileges. It handles all backup jobs
and reads and writes configuration files and log files. It communicates with the
client via D-Bus, which allows the client to scheudule new backups and
manipulate and remove existing jobs etc.
